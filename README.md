# RandomSpitter

A word generator, created to get a random theme for drawing.

## Installation

We use `cargo`, the project manager from Rust.
```sh
$ > cargo build
```

## Usage
You need to mention the type of the words you want to generate.
It should be a category name in the `assets/inktoberthemes.json` file.
```sh
$ > cargo run -- <category>
```
